### Project
=======
* **Hospital Queue System**

## Background of the project

The **hospital queuing system** (HQS) for hospitals will enable management to easily implement its beneficiary handling policies and procedures, and will automatically follow those rules to control the flow. This decreases wait time and service delivery time significantly. Each beneficiary may be routed to their corresponding counters automatically. Otherwise, the recipients will be forced to wait in a single line, which normally operates on a first-come, first-served basis. This enhances the experience and assists management in providing a peaceful and welcoming environment for the recipients.
